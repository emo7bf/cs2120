# Introduce Your Group!

The first thing you're going to do is break up into a group of either 3 or 4. We will use $G$ to refer to the set of members in your group. Fill in the members of $G$ on your worksheet.

Next you're going to identify a set $F$ to make this statement true: 

$\forall x \in G. \forall y \in G. \exists f \in F. (x \neq y) \land A(x,f) \land A(y,f)$

Where $A(a,b)$: fun fact $b$ is true of group member $a$. 

In other words, for each pair of members of your group, find a fact that both members have in common. Fill in the members of $F$ on your worksheet, then identify which two members share each fact.
