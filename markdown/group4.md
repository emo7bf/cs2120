title: Group Activity 4 | Discrete Math, Games, and Family
...

Put your answers for each problem of this activity in this [worksheet](/files/group4.pdf).

# Directions

This activity is designed to be done in a group, whether that's in class, at home with family, or with suite-mates, friends, or people you meet on the bus or in an airport. 

- **If you're working on this in class**, please first form a group of approximately 3 people (+/- 1 person). Once you've done that, grab some cookies! The cookies are nut- and chocolate-free. Unfortunately we have no gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, or vegan options today. If you have dietary restrictions that prevent you from being able to enjoy today's treat, just let Nathan Brunelle know and he can make it up to you on a future date.

- **If you're working on this elsewhere**, find at least 1 other person (but ideally 2) to participate in this activity with you. Your partner(s) definitely don't need to have any math/cs background, but be prepared to teach some discrete math to someone! We tried to pick topics that would be fun to discuss, hopefully this is an overall positive experience. When completing your activity you may print our the worksheet above, or roughly reproduce it on your own paper. To submit, upload an image of your answers to the quiz site under Group4.

Below you will see that there are 4 different activities available. You're welcome to work through these in any order you please, and are not expected to finish all of them. Regardless of where/when you're working, please spend at least 50 minutes on the activity. Indicate your start time (**problem 1**) and end time (**problem 2**) on your sheet.


# Introduce Your Team/Family!

Give the names of all members of your group. Indicate the your relation to each group member and how much Math/CS experience/education they have. (**problem 1**).
