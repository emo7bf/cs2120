title: Group Activity 4 | Counting Cranberries
...

Put your answers for each problem of this activity in this [worksheet](/files/group4.pdf).

# Directions

This activity is designed to be done in a group, whether that's in class, at home with family, or with suite-mates, friends, or people you meet on the bus or in an airport. 

- **If you're working on this in class**, please first form a group of approximately 3 people (+/- 1 person). Once you've done that, grab some cookies! The cookies are nut- and chocolate-free. Unfortunately we have no gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, or vegan options today. If you have dietary restrictions that prevent you from being able to enjoy today's treat, just let Nathan Brunelle know and he can make it up to you on a future date.

- **If you're working on this elsewhere**, find at least 1 other person (but ideally 2) to participate in this activity with you. Your partner(s) definitely don't need to have any math/cs background, but be prepared to teach some discrete math to someone! When completing your activity you may print our the worksheet above, or roughly reproduce it on your own paper. To submit, upload an image of your answers to the quiz site under Group4.

For this activity you will be solving a series of Thanksgiving-themed counting problems.


# Introduce Your Team/Family!

Give the names of all members of your group. Indicate the your relationship to each group member (write "classmate" if you're doing this activity in class). (**problem 1**). (If you're in class, you may skip problem 1a. If you're at home, you'll get to problem 1a later)

# Introduce Your (Thanksgiving) Dinner!

**If you're in class**: Have each person in your group share their two favorite items to have at Thanksgiving dinner. If you do not celebrate Thanksgiving, then just name at least one food that you enjoy to eat with your family. Write down the set of all dishes you've named (**Problem 2**). We'll refer to this set as $D$ in a future problem

**If you're at home**: Select one meal that you've had over the break (ideally your Thanksgiving meal, if you celebrate that holiday, but any meal will do). List all of the items that were included in that meal and write those down (**Problem 2**). We'll refer to this set as $D$ in a future problem.

# Counting Meals

**If you're in class**: We'll define a "helping" to be any non-empty subset of dishes from the set $D$. How many different helpings are there for you set $D$? (**Problem 3**)

**If you're at home**: We'll define a "helping" to be any non-empty subset of dishes from the set $D$. First ask your team/family to estimate the number of different helpings there are for the meal you used to define the set $D$ (**Problem 1a**). Next calculate for yourself the number of helpings. Tell your team/family the number, explaining how you arrived at it. Give a high-five to whoever guessed the closest.

# More Counting Problems

**If you're in class**: Do each of the following problems together

**If you're at home**: You're welcome to work on these problems with your team/family, but if they're tired and grumpy from all the feasting, you're welcome to work on them alone.

## How many Feasts in the Professors' Thanksgivings?

For this first set of problems we'll be analyzing how many different Thanksgiving feasts Nate and Elizbeth could have.

Nate and Elizabeth will have the following at their Thanksgiving dinner:
- Turkey
- Mashed Potatoes
- Dressing
- Green Beans
- Corn
- Cranberry Sauce
- Sweet potato casserole
- Cornbread
- Macaroni and Cheese

The following items are Gluten-Free:
- Turkey
- Mashed Potatoes
- Corn
- Cranberry Sauce
- Sweet potato casserole
- Cornbread

The following items are vegan:
- Green Beans
- Corn
- Cranberry Sauce
- Sweet Potato casserole

Again, we'll define a "helping" to be any non-empty subset of the items listed above. For example, one helping might be {Turkey, Mashed potatoes, Corn, Cornbread}, and a different helping might be {Corn, Cornbread}. 

**Problem 4**: How many different possible helpings are there for the Professors' Thanksgiving?
