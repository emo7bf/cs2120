# Logistics

## Meetings

Due to COVID-19 student density restrictions, we do not have adequate classroom space for this course, so all class meetings will happen online.

A link to join your section's lectures via Zoom can be found in your section's Collab site.
We noticed a strong correlation last semester between student happiness with the course and attending synchronously with cameras on.
We recommend you arrange your schedule and environment to permit that mode of engagement.

We will generally have time-limited, and sometimes group-work, assignments during the Friday class time.
Monday and Wednesday classes will generally not have such work and can be skipped to be reviewed by recording later if necessary.

## Tasks {#tasks}

The course is organized around four 3-week modules:

1. **Discrete Structures**: sets, sequences, quantifiers, numbers
2. **First-order Logic**: instantiation, direct proofs, proof-by-cases
3. **Contradiction**: proof-by-contradiction, well-ordering principle
4. **Induction**: proof-by-induction, multi-part proofs

Each module will have the following components:

- Between 5 and 11 **lectures**

- Two manually-graded **paper quizzes**
    - You will
        - be given a prompt and a time limit
        - write a solution on paper
        - take a picture of your paper and upload it
    - We will
        - grade based on a rubric
        - upload your grade and comments
        - discuss common mistakes in class
    - Occur during the Friday class time of the second and third week of the module

- Two automatically-graded **online quizzes**
    - You will
        - be given a set of questions with a web form for answering them
        - write clarifying comments if the question is confusingly worded
    - The system will
        - provide a first-pass grade and distribution of grades
    - We will
        - discuss common mistakes in class
        - review comments and adjust grades if appropriate
    - Occur between Friday and Monday classes after the second and third week of the module

- Optionally, one **makeup quiz**
    - A mix of manually-graded and automatically-graded components
    - Delivered the week after a module concludes
    - If taken, replaces your grade for the module (whether better or worse)
    - Due to the very early final exam time given by the university, module 4 will not have this quiz

- One **group project** (except for the fourth module, which has no project)
    - You will
        - work with a partner during scheduled class time
        - finish on your own time, if needed
    - We will
        - review your work
        - award credit based on progress
        - discuss common mistakes in class
    - Occurs during the Friday class the week after a module ends

You will also be expected to read instructional material and either understand it or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet at least weekly all semester long to discuss readings, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.

At the end of the semester, you will also be able to take a **final quiz**.
The final will be a set of four additional makeup quizzes, one for each module, of similar format to earlier makeup quizzes. 
If you chose to take any of these four, your results will replace your grade for that module.
You may chose to take 0, 1, 2, 3, or all 4 of these modules' finals, at your discretion, and can make that choice after you see the contents of the quiz.

## Contact

We'll use 

All
:   We will use **discord** to emulate offices, office hours, office hours queues, etc.
    A discord server join link is in the course's Collab site.
    We recommend downloading the desktop app (at <https://discord.com/>), which has more features and better-quality audio and video, but the browser version should also work.

    For communication about personal circumstances, contact an instructor **directly** via email, telephone, or office hours.

        Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.

## Readings

It is possible to do well in this class based only on in-class instruction.
However, most students find they learn more rapidly and easily if they augment that with appropriate readings.

Our readings come from three sources:

- The free online textbook *Mathematics for Computer Science* by Eric Lehman, Thomson Leighton, and Albert Meyer,
available both [on our site](files/mcs.pdf)
and [on MIT's site](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/readings/MIT6_042JS15_textbook.pdf).
Readings that begin "MCS" refer to sections of that book;
for example, "MCS 1.7" refers to the section "Proof by Cases".

- The free online textbook *forall x Calgary Remix* by P D Mangus *et al*,
available both [on our site](files/forallx.pdf)
and [from the Open Logic Project](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/).
Readings that begin "∀x" refer to sections of that book;
for example, "∀x 15.1" refers to the section "The idea of a formal proof".

- Write-ups by our course staff, hosted on this site and provided by a link.

I will use ".0" to mean "the text before .1";
for example, "∀x 1.0" is the content of chapter 1 preceding section 1.1.

## Proofs

You will both write and read proofs as part of this class.
If you have had a proof-heavy math class before, you know what to expect here.
If not, think of proof writing as being more similar to code writing than to other forms of mathematics homework in terms of time needed and difficulty of estimating exact time needed for any given problem.


# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what we believe grades mean.
We hope that the following numerical system will approximate that.
If you think your score in the course does not reflect your understanding of course material, please let us know.

Your grade is divided into 4 modules.
We want you to do well in all four of the modules, as each covers content needed in later courses.
To incentivize mastering all four areas, your grade will be computed as follows:

- We score the assessments each module separately, as $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$, and $m_4$
- We compute the minimum of those four scores, $n = \min(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4)$
- We compute the maximum of those four scores, $x = \max(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4)$
- Your combined modules score is the lesser of $10+n$ and $x$: $s = \min(10+n,x)$
- Your overall score is 94% the combined modules scores, 6% the three group projects: $0.94 s + 0.02 (g_1 + g_2 + g_3)$

Your overall score will be converted to a letter and recording in SIS, as follows:

You get     or  if you score     Which is worth
----------  --- ------------    ----------------
A+          CR  near the top           4.0
A           CR  &ge; 93%               4.0
A&minus;    CR  &ge; 90%               3.7
B+          CR  &ge; 87%               3.3
B           CR  &ge; 83%               3.0
B&minus;    CR  &ge; 80%               2.7
C+          CR  &ge; 77%               2.3
C[^1]       CR  &ge; 70%               2.0
D+          GC  &ge; 67%               1.3
D           GC  &ge; 63%               1.0
D&minus;    GC  &ge; 60%               0.7
F           NC  otherwise              0.0

[^1]:
    Why no C&minus;?
    
    CS prereqs require a C&minus or better grad in CS 2102.
    But the university has defined the line between GC and CR as the line between C and C&minus;.
    To avoid any "I would have made the prereq if I'd chosen a different grading system" concerns, we've removed the C&minus; grade so these two systems become compatible.

Missed auto-graded evaluations will not be rescheduled, extended, nor made up during the semester.
Missed hand-graded evaluations may be rescheduled with adequate notice and reasoning (sent to your instructor via email).

UVA does not award credit for placement tests.
Hence, you must show continuing evidence of engagement and learning throughout the course.
Doing well on the final quiz alone will not result in a passing grade unless such evidence is in hand.
If you feel you deserve an exception to this rule, please contact your instructor for more.

# Miscellanea

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

## Honesty

We always hope everyone will behave honestly.
We know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell us the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

The quizzes allow consulting many resources.
However, if you consult resources other than course material, you **must** cite any and every source you consult in the comments of the question.
Talked to a friend, saw an interesting video, consulted a website, had a tutor?
Tell us!

### Obey collaboration limitations

Quizzes may not be done in groups or in consultation with any resource that did not exist prior to the quiz being posted.

### Consequences of Dishonesty

If we believe you have acted dishonestly, we will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information we lack, please share that with us; we may thereafter change our belief and/or proposed penalty.

If we are not able to come to an agreement, or if the case is particularly egregious and beyond our comfort level handling in-course, we will instead refer the case to the University Honor System and abide by their findings.


## Personal accommodations

### Disability

If you qualify for accommodations from [the SDAC](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac), please let your instructor know, preferably in a private conversation so we can discuss how your accommodations will interplay with the content delivery and assessment structure of this course.

### Religious observances

We fully support [the university's stance](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) on accommodating religious observances.
If such observances or other religious beliefs impact or are likely to impact your work this semester,
please let us know as soon as you are aware of this impact.

### Culture

All communication relies on shared context and understanding.
Because no member of our course staff has the same context and experience as you, it is likely we will inadvertently say and do things you find confusing or offensive. Please let us know if this happens! We will do our best to learn and adjust so we can become better and more welcoming communicators in the future, and do what we can to fix any problems our mistakes we've caused.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
People get sick.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, talk to your instructor and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.
