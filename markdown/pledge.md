# Course Pledge

## Honor Expectations

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs2120 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:

- **I will not lie, cheat or steal.** If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.
- **I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policies on each assignment.** In particular, while taking a quiz I will not consult resources disallowed by [course policy](/policies.html#honesty).


## Community Expectations

As a member of a learning community of students, faculty, and staff,
you are expected to exemplify these behaviors in cs2120:

**I will actively affirm the value and dignity of others and treat my
  peers with decency and respect.** I understand that one of the
  benefits of attending the University is to be part of a vibrant
  community that encompasses a wide range of backgrounds, ethnicities,
  personal and family histories, and world views. I will contribute to
  that community by sharing things that are unique about me with
  others, fighting against any biases I may have or that I observe in
  others, and being open to and respectful of people who are different
  from me. I will listen to the perspectives of others, and amplify
  those whose voices are not well heard.

**I will not behave in ways that harrass, intimidate, diminish, or
  belittle others.** If I observe such behaviors in others (including
  among my classmates, the course staff, or other University faculty),
  I will not tolerate them silently, but will either take it upon
  myself to mitigate them, or will inform one of the course
  instructors or another University administrator.

**I will care for myself physically and emotionally.** I will ensure that whatever
  I am doing to succeed in my courses does not take priority over my
  needs to exercise, stay hydrated, make time to eat lunch and dinner
  away from my workspace, and to safely spend time outside.

**I will be connected with others, and look out for the well-being of
my classmates.** I will be creative in
maintaining and reinforcing communities in my classes and living spaces
I will seek safe social interactions with fellow
students and others in the university community.

**I will ask for help.** I will make a reasonable effort to do things
on my own first, and will work collaboratively with my classmates when permitted, but will ask the course staff for
help before getting overly frustrated. There are many ways to ask for
help including the class discord server and office hours.

**I will be open minded and curious.** I understand that this course
  may do things in ways differently from what I expect, and may
  sometimes buck conventions that have been followed in other courses
  I have taken. I will ask questions when things make me
  uncomfortable, but also accept that being surprised, facing
  uncertainty, and being challenged with problems it is unreasonable
  to expect me to be able to solve, are often beneficial for learning
  new ways of thinking.

**I grant the course staff permission to reproduce excerpts from my
  submissions for teaching purposes.** My work will be attributed when
  it is shown in a postive way, but may be used anonymously if it is
  used to illustrate common pitfalls or other issues.

**I will provide useful feedback.**  It is important that I
  let the course staff know what they need to improve the course. I
  will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course
  staff directly. I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
  thoroughly.
