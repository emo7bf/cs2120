# Induction and Well-Ordering

Over the last two weeks we have discussed two ways of proving theorems like $\forall x\in \mathbb{N}. P(x)$ -- proof by induction and proof by contradiction using Well-Ordering. During this week's group activity we will explore the relationship between these two strategies, and apply them to some new situations.
