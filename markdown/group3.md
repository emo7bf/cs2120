# Induction and Well-Ordering

Over the last two weeks we have discussed two ways of proving theorems like $\forall x\in \mathbb{N}. P(x)$ -- proof by induction and proof by contradiction using Well-Ordering. During this week's group activity we will explore the relationship between these two strategies, and apply them to some new situations.




## Proof by Contradiction Using Well-Ordering

If you recall from class, the Well-Ordering Principle states "Every non-empty subset of the Natural numbers has a least element". The general template for how we use this idea to construct a proof that $\forall x\in \mathbb{N}. P(x)$ is as follows:

1. Begin by assuming the negation of our theorem toward reaching a contradiction. That is, assume $\lnot\big(\forall x\in \mathbb{N}. P(x)\big)\equiv \big( \exists x \in \mathbb{N}. \neg P(x)\big)$.
